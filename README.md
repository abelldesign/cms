# CMS

A simple cms that uses react, redux, firebase, and the ORY editor to create websites.

TODO to create Minimum Viable Product:
* Page support - print content to generated pages
* Partial Support - will create ORY editor components on the fly, hopefully
* Template Support - will allow reuse of templates between pages, helps with ehader and footer config.
* Page support - choose a template to wrap around your content
* Setup profile to include permissions - we don't want anyone editing your site
* Tests
* Documentation
* Make it pretty
